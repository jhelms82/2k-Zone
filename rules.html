    <p>-Before regular season or Tournament play begins, all teams must have NBA 2K Zone League official registration info submitted through
   via registration.</p>
<p>-All teams must have desired payment amount paid in full prior to tip-off via PayPal, Cash App or Venmo.</p>
<p>-Registered teams are required to have a Team Twitter page and a Team logo.</p>
<p>-Team Captain and Team Twitter page are required to be following the NBA 2K Zone League Twitter Page @2kZoneLeague.
Maximum of two players are allowed in the APAA Captains chat (Captain and Co-Captain).</p>
<p>-Streaming: All teams must have a minimum of one player (does not have to be team owner) streaming each game per matchup. 
*Please make sure the streamer has “Store past broadcasts” turned ON under Twitch Channel Settings in their dashboard in case of dispute or rule violation! Same rules apply if streaming on YouTube!</p>
<p>-Reg Season Connection Issues: There are no spreads in the regular season! If one or more players on one team lag-out before the end of the 1st quarter, the game must be restarted and the “lagging team” must show proof of their lag-out.
*Whether the lag-out is true or not, please restart the game and play it out! If the “non-lagging team” wins in the end, then there is no need for a dispute. If the “lagging team” wins the restarted match, that team must provide proof of lag-out from previous match!
**If any “lag-out” or “quit match” happens after 4:59 showing on the game-clock of the 2nd quarter, the game must be played out to the end, tough luck!</p>
<p>-The Buddy Rule: Only rostered players can play on other rostered players accounts. If sufficient evidence is provided of a non-rostered player playing on a rostered players account, that team will forfeit every game of that series in which the non-rostered player played in. Second violation will result in being banned for the remainder of the active season.</p><br><br>
